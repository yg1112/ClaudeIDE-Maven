      "title": "The AI productivity paradox: supposed to save time, but adds mental overhead?",
      "body": "I'm having a weird productivity crisis and wondering if anyone else feels this way.  \n  \n**Background:** I work as a developer and recently started using AI coding assistants (Claude Code, specifically). The output is amazing - it genuinely saves hours on certain tasks.  \n  \n**The problem:** I'm spending so much mental energy \\*crafting the perfect prompt\\* that I'm not sure I'm actually saving time overall.  \n  \nHere's a typical interaction:  \n1. Sit down to use AI for a task  \n2. Spend 5-10 minutes thinking: \"How do I phrase this?\"  \n3. Type out a detailed prompt  \n4. Get a response that's 80% right  \n5. Spend another 5 minutes refining the prompt  \n6. Finally get what I need  \n  \n**Total time:** 15-20 minutes of prompt engineering  \n  \n**What I could have done in that time:** Maybe just coded it myself?  \n  \nThe irony is killing me. AI is supposed to be the ultimate productivity tool, but I feel like I've traded one cognitive load (writing code) for another (writing perfect prompts).  \n  \n**What makes it worse:** I can't just talk through the problem. I'm a verbal thinker - I solve problems by talking them out. But speech-to-text gives me rambling, messy transcripts full of \"uh\" and \"you know\" that are useless for AI prompts.  \n  \nSo I'm stuck typing. And typing slows down my thinking.  \n  \n**Question:** How do you handle this? Do you:  \n\\- Just accept the prompt overhead as part of the process?  \n\\- Use voice somehow (and if so, how do you keep it clean)?  \n\\- Only use AI for specific types of tasks where the tradeoff makes sense?  \n\\- Have some other workflow hack I'm missing?  \n  \nGenuinely curious if I'm alone in this or if others feel the same friction.",

      "title": "Tested 70+ AI tools in 2025, here's what actually improved my workflow",
      "body": "Spent 2025 testing AI tools. Kept a spreadsheet tracking what I actually used vs what just sat there collecting dust. 70+ tools later, here's what survived.\n\nStarted with coding tools. Cursor replaced VS Code for me completely. The inline suggestions actually understand context instead of just autocompleting random garbage. Also tried ZCode and CodeFlicker but went back to Cursor. Gemini CLI is solid for terminal work when I don't want to leave the command line.\n\nContent creation was messier. Tried probably 20 different tools. Loomi stuck around for social scheduling. Gamma APP for presentations when I can't avoid making slides. AmyMind for quick mind maps but honestly I still prefer pen and paper half the time. X-Design for visual stuff when I need logos or graphics to match across different formats.\n\nProductivity category is where I wasted the most money. Supertonic for text to speech because it runs locally. WiseMindAI for research when I need to dig through papers. Belin Doc translates documents without mangling the formatting which is rare.\n\nWhat actually worked: AI tools are good when they solve one specific problem. The ones that try to do everything usually suck at everything. The \"AI powered\" label means nothing if the workflow is broken.\n\nBiggest gain came from combining tools instead of looking for one magic solution. AI generates first draft, I refine it. AI handles repetitive stuff, I make creative calls.\n\nCost reality, most tools are $10 to $20 per month. I'm paying $85 monthly for 5 tools right now. Still cheaper than hiring freelancers but only if you actually use them. I cancelled probably 15 subscriptions this year.\n\nNew tools launch every week. FOMO is real. I wasted time testing tools that were basically the same as what I already had with a different UI.\n\nMy advice: figure out your biggest time sink first. Find one tool that fixes it. Use it for a month before adding anything else. Tool hopping kills productivity more than it helps.\n\nThe tools that stuck are the ones I use 3+ times per week. Everything else got cut.",

      "body": "I'm the developer of Freevoice Reader. \n\nI'm making a limited number of lifetime access codes available.\n\nFreevoice Reader is a Mac app (Apple Silicon only) that does \n- Instant dictation\n- Read selected text aloud in natural voices\n- Follow commands and edit text using AI\n\nThere are a few other experimental features: \n- Voice Cloning\n- Subtitle generation \n- Meeting transcription and diarization\n\nLifetime access unlocks all features including experimental features and all future features. You can use the code on up to 3 Macs.\n\nIf you'd like a lifetime code:\n\nUpvote and leave a comment\n\nI'll reply with a code within the next day. Codes are shared privately and not posted publicly. \n\nLink: https://freevoicereader.com/mac-app\n\nWhat makes FreeVoice Reader different compared to other dictation apps:\n- Most dictation apps available for MacOS fail to leverage the Apple Silicon architecture as they support even the earlier chips. I built this app specifically for Apple Silicon chips (M1 and later) and the results are impressive. \n\nWhat models do we use: \nWe use the best open source models. \n- For dictation, you can choose between Parakeet V3 (25 languages), Parakeet V2, Whisper (99+ languages)\n- Reading aloud: KokoroTTS and a few others\n- Text editing: Apple Intelligence which can be swapped for Qwen 2.5 and a few other models\n\nHappy to answer any questions. Thanks for taking a look!\n\n",

      "title": "Ottex AI - native macOS app to type with your voice (Free with BYOK)",
      "body": "// Note: All the text below is typed with my voice.\n\nHey everyone!\n\nI built a free macOS app to type with your voice.\n\nWould love to hear what you think, especially if you have used Wispr Flow or similar tools.\n\n## Meet Ottex\n\nOttex AI is a native macOS app to type with your voice anywhere on your Mac.\n\nI'm a big fan of Wispr Flow and Raycast macOS applications, especially AI shortcuts in Raycast. At some point, I realized that LLMs are already freakingly good with voice-to-text handling, and you don't need anymore to raise $80 million to create a voice-to-text application.\n\nI decided to build Ottex AI to give people freedom to work with any AI model and just have fun with modern AI technologies without paying multiple subscription fees for features that cost pennies in API requests.\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. Global macOS voice-to-text in any app that produces clean and clear text free of filler words, repetitions, and rambling. Dump your stream of consciousness \u2014 get coherent and clear text.\n2. Raycast omnibar with AI shortcuts. Select text and execute LLM prompts on top of selected text. My favorite shortcuts are \"fix grammar\", \"translate to {language}\" as an argument, and \"improve writing\". You can create custom shortcuts if you want.\n3. Ottex AI is dirt cheap. It's free for personal use and you pay only for OpenRouter API requests. It's basically a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model, so for me as a heavy user, it costs something like $3 per month, and casual users like my wife have something around 50 cents of voice transcriptions per month.\n4. Zero logging, privacy first. Your API requests, your audio files, and your AI shortcut inputs are sent directly to OpenRouter. We don't see them, we don't touch them, we don't store anything, we don't train models on top of your data, and we don't even have servers to handle this lol. So complete privacy if you trust OpenRouter.\n\nOttex connects directly to OpenRouter and fetches models from there, so you have complete flexibility between the models you choose for different features. For example:\n\n- For voice, you can swap between efficient models like Gemini 3.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, or Mistral Voxtral and upgrade to newer models whenever they come to OpenRouter.\n- For AI shortcuts, you are basically free to use any model available on OpenRouter (including free models) if it supports structured outputs.\n\nOnce more, the application is free. Try it out, let me know if you run into any bugs or have feature ideas.\n\nThank you and have a nice day!\n\n// Download the app from the website: [https://ottex.ai](https://ottex.ai)\n",

Built to be fast, invisible, and actually free.\n\nWhat's different?\n\nIt's a joy to use. Strong focus on UX. A lot of attention went into the hotkey behavior and workflow. Each action should save you a couple fractions of a second, which adds up.\n\nYou have access to your clipboard and voice transcriptions right from the menu bar. Most people don't use a clipboard manager, combining the two made sense to me.\n\nThere's also an adaptive self-learning dictionary, quick actions, and a bunch of small UX details that you probably won't notice but make the whole thing feel invisible. Formatting per app all happens seamlessly in the background and costs just \\~25 cents per month with your own api key.\n\nFree forever, no signups, no nonsense. I'll be continually updating it as better models release. Open source planned, but it is notarized and signed by Apple for now and works completely offline.

      "body": "Hey dear Redditors \ud83d\udc4b\n\nNot so long ago I've introduced MCP in Fluent. It's now time to get back to the writing origins of Fluent, and reveal a really neat feature \u2013 **Memory**.\n\nIt's a **native RAG engine** tuned for **writing tasks.** You can load your own writing samples and docs and generate content in your style with a single shortcut.\n\nHere are the use cases:  \n\\- **Semantic search**. This one is obvious. Any data research & analysis becomes incredibly quick and simple. Analyze your spending habits, exercise with AI for exams, attach specific knowledge to your requests to ground the results \u2013 possibilities are infinite.  \n\\- **One-shot** messages, Emails, blog posts, \u2013 basically any content without a single character typed or dictated.  \n\\- **How?** By loading your or anyone else's writing samples & knowledge into Fluent Memory.  \n\\- **Precision is more than 80%** based on my tests. If one-shot doesn't satisfy me, I usually get at least a good idea of it and refine it.  \n\\- Effectively **teach AI humor,** which is really a banger.\n\nFeel free to try it out \u2013 [https://fluentmac.app/](https://fluentmac.app/)\n\nAs always, your feedback is really appreciated. Fluent's features and improvements are 90% driven by users, many of whom are tech-savvy Redditors. Thank you \ud83d\udc95 And traditionally, I share an **exclusive** 25% discount code for Reddit: **REDDIT25.** Note: it has a **30** redemption limit this time.\n\nP.S. This post was not generated by AI. But it finally could be \ud83d\ude0a\n\n>Disclaimer: what's shown in the video was purely a research & testing stage. I personally do not one-shot content, but it makes sense in many scenarios: support or other inquiries, changelogs, reports, quick messages and so on. For any **creative** work it is assistive and often brings you fresh ideas, better layout and message, while keeping your voice. At the end you need less time and refine less things.\n\n>For best writing results, always have a lean group of your writing samples for the specific audience or domain (e.g. your Discord messages) and feed it the context of your app or browser **and additional context on the topic** you're writing on (e.g. specific macOS app) \u2013 so AI knows not only how to write, but exactly what it is about.  \n  \nCheck out [this blog post](https://fluentmac.app/blog/long-term-memory-rag-for-your-mac) to learn more on Memory.",
