      "title": "Introducing FreeVoice Reader for Apple Silicon \u2013 Your Voice, Instantly Typed",
      "body": "I'm the developer of Freevoice Reader. \n\nI'm making a limited number of lifetime access codes available.\n\nFreevoice Reader is a Mac app (Apple Silicon only) that does \n- Instant dictation\n- Read selected text aloud in natural voices\n- Follow commands and edit text using AI\n\nThere are a few other experimental features: \n- Voice Cloning\n- Subtitle generation \n- Meeting transcription and diarization\n\nLifetime access unlocks all features including experimental features and all future features. You can use the code on up to 3 Macs.\n\nIf you'd like a lifetime code:\n\nUpvote and leave a comment\n\nI'll reply with a code within the next day. Codes are shared privately and not posted publicly. \n\nLink: https://freevoicereader.com/mac-app\n\nWhat makes FreeVoice Reader different compared to other dictation apps:\n- Most dictation apps available for MacOS fail to leverage the Apple Silicon architecture as they support even the earlier chips. I built this app specifically for Apple Silicon chips (M1 and later) and the results are impressive. \n\nWhat models do we use: \nWe use the best open source models. \n- For dictation, you can choose between Parakeet V3 (25 languages), Parakeet V2, Whisper (99+ languages)\n- Reading aloud: KokoroTTS and a few others\n- Text editing: Apple Intelligence which can be swapped for Qwen 2.5 and a few other models\n\nHappy to answer any questions. Thanks for taking a look!\n\n",

      "title": "Ottex AI - native macOS app to type with your voice (Free with BYOK)",
      "body": "// Note: All the text below is typed with my voice.\n\nHey everyone!\n\nI built a free macOS app to type with your voice.\n\nWould love to hear what you think, especially if you have used Wispr Flow or similar tools.\n\n## Meet Ottex\n\nOttex AI is a native macOS app to type with your voice anywhere on your Mac.\n\nI'm a big fan of Wispr Flow and Raycast macOS applications, especially AI shortcuts in Raycast. At some point, I realized that LLMs are already freakingly good with voice-to-text handling, and you don't need anymore to raise $80 million to create a voice-to-text application.\n\nI decided to build Ottex AI to give people freedom to work with any AI model and just have fun with modern AI technologies without paying multiple subscription fees for features that cost pennies in API requests.\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. Global macOS voice-to-text in any app that produces clean and clear text free of filler words, repetitions, and rambling. Dump your stream of consciousness \u2014 get coherent and clear text.\n2. Raycast omnibar with AI shortcuts. Select text and execute LLM prompts on top of selected text. My favorite shortcuts are \"fix grammar\", \"translate to {language}\" as an argument, and \"improve writing\". You can create custom shortcuts if you want.\n3. Ottex AI is dirt cheap. It's free for personal use and you pay only for OpenRouter API requests. It's basically a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model, so for me as a heavy user, it costs something like $3 per month, and casual users like my wife have something around 50 cents of voice transcriptions per month.\n4. Zero logging, privacy first. Your API requests, your audio files, and your AI shortcut inputs are sent directly to OpenRouter. We don't see them, we don't touch them, we don't store anything, we don't train models on top of your data, and we don't even have servers to handle this lol. So complete privacy if you trust OpenRouter.\n\nOttex connects directly to OpenRouter and fetches models from there, so you have complete flexibility between the models you choose for different features. For example:\n\n- For voice, you can swap between efficient models like Gemini 3.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, or Mistral Voxtral and upgrade to newer models whenever they come to OpenRouter.\n- For AI shortcuts, you are basically free to use any model available on OpenRouter (including free models) if it supports structured outputs.\n\nOnce more, the application is free. Try it out, let me know if you run into any bugs or have feature ideas.\n\nThank you and have a nice day!\n\n// Download the app from the website: [https://ottex.ai](https://ottex.ai)\n",

      "body": "I started this project about a year ago and have been using it myself for the past few months. Built to be fast, invisible, and actually free.\n\nWhat's different?\n\nIt's a joy to use. Strong focus on UX. A lot of attention went into the hotkey behavior and workflow. Each action should save you a couple fractions of a second, which adds up.\n\nYou have access to your clipboard and voice transcriptions right from the menu bar. Most people don't use a clipboard manager, combining the two made sense to me.\n\nThere's also an adaptive self-learning dictionary, quick actions, and a bunch of small UX details that you probably won't notice but make the whole thing feel invisible. Formatting per app all happens seamlessly in the background and costs just \\~25 cents per month with your own api key.\n\nFree forever, no signups, no nonsense. I'll be continually updating it as better models release. Open source planned, but it is notarized and signed by Apple for now and works completely offline. Give it a shot!\n\n[https://www.pipitvoice.com/](https://www.pipitvoice.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/greb3emn4dag1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8684c09c1b71ce0c5e46dae94a2db8cf3976e38b\n\n",

      "title": "Long-Term Memory (RAG) for your Mac \u2013 Introducing Fluent 1.7",
      "body": "Hey dear Redditors \ud83d\udc4b\n\nNot so long ago I've introduced MCP in Fluent. It's now time to get back to the writing origins of Fluent, and reveal a really neat feature \u2013 **Memory**.\n\nIt's a **native RAG engine** tuned for **writing tasks.** You can load your own writing samples and docs and generate content in your style with a single shortcut.\n\nHere are the use cases:  \n\\- **Semantic search**. This one is obvious. Any data research & analysis becomes incredibly quick and simple. Analyze your spending habits, exercise with AI for exams, attach specific knowledge to your requests to ground the results \u2013 possibilities are infinite.  \n\\- **One-shot** messages, Emails, blog posts, \u2013 basically any content without a single character typed or dictated.  \n\\- **How?** By loading your or anyone else's writing samples & knowledge into Fluent Memory.  \n\\- **Precision is more than 80%** based on my tests. If one-shot doesn't satisfy me, I usually get at least a good idea of it and refine it.  \n\\- Effectively **teach AI humor,** which is really a banger.\n\nFeel free to try it out \u2013 [https://fluentmac.app/](https://fluentmac.app/)\n\nAs always, your feedback is really appreciated. Fluent's features and improvements are 90% driven by users, many of whom are tech-savvy Redditors. Thank you \ud83d\udc95 And traditionally, I share an **exclusive** 25% discount code for Reddit: **REDDIT25.** Note: it has a **30** redemption limit this time.\n\nP.S. This post was not generated by AI. But it finally could be \ud83d\ude0a\n\n>Disclaimer: what's shown in the video was purely a research & testing stage. I personally do not one-shot content, but it makes sense in many scenarios: support or other inquiries, changelogs, reports, quick messages and so on. For any **creative** work it is assistive and often brings you fresh ideas, better layout and message, while keeping your voice. At the end you need less time and refine less things.\n\n>For best writing results, always have a lean group of your writing samples for the specific audience or domain (e.g. your Discord messages) and feed it the context of your app or browser **and additional context on the topic** you're writing on (e.g. specific macOS app) \u2013 so AI knows not only how to write, but exactly what it is about.  \n  \nCheck out [this blog post](https://fluentmac.app/blog/long-term-memory-rag-for-your-mac) to learn more on Memory.",
